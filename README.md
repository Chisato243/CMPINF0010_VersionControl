This is a simple Python program created for our lab. The program takes a user's name and age as input and then displays a message including the user's name and age.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter their name.
2. It then prompts the user to enter their age.
3. Finally, it outputs a message displaying the user's name and age.
